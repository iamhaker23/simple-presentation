            <h1 id="part1">Being a consumer vs. being curious</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The problem; we as a society risk dwindling our technical expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why? A growing trend is that children are developing more interest in consuming technology rather than developing
                    or understanding it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this trend is sustained, the tech industry may cause it's own crisis through nurturing consumerism over inspiring curiosity.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 id="part2">Why might this be?</h1>
            <div>
            
                <p>Some hypothesis about why this might be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Effective marketing of games, music and video creates pressure for parent to provide technology but no pressure to stimulate curiosity.</li>
                    <li>There is little pressure for anyone to actually understand any aspect of technology.</li>
                    <li>The information is too dense, because of how advanced and saturated technology sector is.</li>
                    <li>The reward for learning and understanding how our technological world works is obscure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 id="part3">How does this relate to BT?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>As a producer of hardware and software goods and provider of tech. services, some of the onus for balancing social responsibility lays with BT.</p>
                <p>Other parties share this responsibility, for example Department for Education, but as an industry leader with such a large-scale portfolio, BT can lead and support the initiative to secure the future of innovation.</p>
                <p>The idea links to the corporate responsibility for all products and services BT provides: it's the influence BT has over the future generations.</p>
                <p>Does BT rely on society to continue to produce it's engineers and business people autonomously forever? Or does this need to be influenced?</p>
                <p>Let us think about the reports of healthcare professionals; our society is not producing enough people to supply the demand for healthcare professionals. So much so that the NHS has had to introduce monetary incentives to entice people to become qualified!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 id="part4">So what is to be done?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Firstly, validation of the problem must be done. Is the problem wide enough to concern BT, and to warrant solving?</p>
                <p>The proposed validation centres around the question (which is not one that is usually considered in a product roll-out):</p>
                <p><br/>"What is developmental impact on a child growing up with a 100MB Internet Connection and a games console?"</p>
                <p>Then the contributing factors must be identified:</p>
                <p><br/><a href="#part2">See the hypothesis in Part 2.</a></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 id="part5">And if there is a problem?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>A potential solution is:</p>
                <p><br/>To develop a scheme of educational, interactive sessions that aim to encourage curiosity and understanding in and of technology.</p>
                <p><br/>Provide interactive sessions to students in school, or extra-curricular.</p>
                <p>Supplement these sessions with a channel that is available beyond the session, and is engaging for the students (for example, interactive games on popular platforms).</p>
                <p><br/>The aim is to engage the children in educational tasks, and ensure that engagement is ongoing (because you can't learn about all of technology in a day).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 id="part6">Action plan</h1>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Engage stakeholders and establish roles and relationships</li>
                    <li>2. Validate the assumptions made, and ensure the problem definition is correct</li>
                    <li>3. Produce a technology curriculum with partners</li>
                    <li>4. Develop a game/interactive app that delivers the curriculum, and is available outside of sessions.</li>
                    <li>5. Deliver sessions using BT Volunteering time, to schools, to get feedback and to build awareness of the project</li>
                    <li>6. Validate and either iterate or cancel the project</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 id="part7">What would I do?</h1>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure stakeholder visibility and engagement at relevant stages - Department of Education, schools, relevant technology partners</li>
                    <li>Broker the partnerships and manage relationships - explain the scheme and the benefits.</li>
                    <li>Help guide development and validation processes for the curriculum and app</li>
                    <li>Ensure deliveries of sessions and collect feedback</li>
                </ul>
                <p><br/>The idea utilises existing volunteering time and existing relationships as per BT's existing initiatives</p>
